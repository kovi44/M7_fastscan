# M7_fastscan
Skylink by M7 / Fastscan Analyser / FNT &amp; FST export / supporting Czech and Slovak channel map

The European satellite operator M7 uses a non (DVB) standard way of signaling the channel map / lineup publicly know as FASTSCAN. In general many people think thats standard way of channel lineup distribution based on DVB spec. Unfortunatelly, it's not true. It's a vendor specific solution which is inspired by the DVB where BAT & NIT table is used for such a purpose. 

The goal of this program is provide the ability to export FNT and FST data for analysis purposes.
